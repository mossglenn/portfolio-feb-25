          Most researchers see compliance training as just another bureaucratic

📌 Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) and Controlled Tier (CT) TrainingA Case Study in Research Ethics Instructional Design

Hook: Transforming Compliance Training into Ethical Action

Most researchers see compliance training as just another bureaucratic hurdle—something to check off a list before moving on. But what if training could do more? What if, instead of just enforcing rules, it could inspire researchers to uphold ethical data practices and protect participant trust?

Background & Design Challenge

At the heart of the All of Us Research Program is a core belief: participants and researchers are equal partners in discovery. To uphold this principle, the program required researchers to fully understand their role in protecting privacy and preventing unethical research activities.

As the program prepared to release its Controlled Tier dataset, an urgent need emerged—before researchers could access sensitive participant data, they had to demonstrate a clear understanding of their ethical responsibilities. While traditional human-subject research training was available, many researchers viewed these courses as bureaucratic obligations rather than meaningful learning experiences.

🔹 Our challenge was clear: How do we turn compliance training into an engaging, thought-provoking experience that challenges researchers to think critically about ethical decision-making—rather than just memorizing policy rules?

✅ The Solution: A Transformational Learning Approach to Research Ethics
Instead of relying on policy checklists, this training explored the real-world pressures, biases, and justifications that contribute to ethical lapses in research. By shifting the focus from compliance to ethical reasoning, we helped researchers develop strategies to uphold integrity in their work, reinforcing the importance of participant trust and responsible data use.

✏️ My Role

🎯 Led collaboration with NIH, IRBs, and research compliance teams to align training with federal regulations and program policies

🎯 Designed a tiered learning curriculum covering foundational research ethics to Controlled Tier-specific policies🎯 Developed case-based learning scenarios to reinforce ethical decision-making🎯 Integrated stakeholder feedback to refine content based on real-world research challenges

🧠 Solution & Instructional Design Approach

To ensure the training was engaging, practical, and aligned with compliance standards, I structured the program using progressive learning pathways, scenario-based activities, and accessibility-driven design.
