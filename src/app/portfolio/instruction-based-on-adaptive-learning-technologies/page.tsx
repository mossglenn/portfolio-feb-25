Instruction Based on Adaptive Learning Technologies

📖 Published in The Handbook of Research on Learning and Instruction, 2nd Edition
✍️ Co-Author

Adaptive learning technologies have transformed the way instruction is delivered by personalizing learning experiences based on individual needs. As a contributing author to Chapter 24: Instruction Based on Adaptive Learning Technologies, I explored key questions in the field, including:

🔹 How should instruction adapt to learner differences and changes over time?
🔹 Which learner characteristics (e.g., knowledge state, motivation, learning strategies) should drive adaptation?
🔹 How can adaptive learning technologies optimize instruction by balancing personalization with common challenges all learners face?

Key Contributions

✅ Bridging Research and Practice – Explored how cognitive science, instructional design, and AI-driven learning technologies can work together to create effective, personalized learning experiences.

✅ Adaptive Learning Design Considerations – Discussed how instructional designers can determine what learner characteristics to adapt to and which forms of adaptation are most effective.

✅ What Not to Adapt To – Addressed common misconceptions about adaptive learning, particularly the debunked idea of learning styles and learning preferences as a basis for adaptation. Instead, the chapter emphasizes focusing on evidence-based learner differences—such as prior knowledge and cognitive load—that have a proven impact on learning outcomes.

✅ Balancing Individual and Universal Learning Needs – Examined how adaptive learning should not only respond to individual differences but also address common challenges that most learners face in a given domain.

Why It Matters

This chapter contributes to the scientific foundation of adaptive learning, offering guidance on how to design, implement, and refine adaptive learning technologies based on evidence-based research. It complements my hands-on work in adaptive learning by demonstrating thought leadership in the field and a deep understanding of the theoretical foundations of instructional adaptation.
