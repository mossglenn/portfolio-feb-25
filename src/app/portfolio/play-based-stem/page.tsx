Play-Based STEM Curriculum: Supporting the Growth of a Leading STEAM Franchise

Hands-on learning is one of the most effective ways to engage young learners in STEM and engineering concepts. When Snapology, now the No. 1 children’s STEM/STEAM franchise, was still in its early years, I developed Lego-based STEM learning modules that introduced children to engineering, physics, and scientific problem-solving through play.

The Challenge

Traditional STEM education often relies on abstract explanations that can feel disconnected from real-world applications. The goal of this curriculum was to:

🔹 Engage children in hands-on problem-solving by integrating Lego-based challenges that encourage experimentation and discovery.
🔹 Introduce engineering and physics concepts through building, testing, and iteration, rather than passive instruction.
🔹 Provide instructors with structured lesson plans that ensure consistency across locations and instructors, making it easier to scale.

The Solution

I designed structured yet flexible STEM learning experiences, helping Snapology create highly engaging, inquiry-based lessons that could be replicated and adapted across locations. The curriculum included:

✅ Structural Engineering Activities – Encouraging students to build towers, bridges, and weight-bearing structures to learn about stability, balance, and load distribution.
✅ Simple Machines & Mechanical Advantage – Using gears, pulleys, and levers to introduce students to force, motion, and efficiency.
✅ Problem-Solving & Inquiry-Based Learning – Designed challenges where students tested solutions, refined their designs, and iterated—mirroring the engineering design process.

Impact & Growth

Since its founding in 2010, Snapology has grown into the top-ranked children’s STEM franchise, expanding to over 180 locations internationally. By 2023, it was recognized as one of Entrepreneur’s Fastest-Growing Franchises, doubling franchise signings and opening 21 new locations. The structured, engaging learning experiences I helped develop in its early years contributed to the strong educational foundation that has supported this rapid growth and success.

Why It Matters

By integrating play-based STEM education into a structured curriculum, I helped create engaging, scalable learning experiences that continue to impact thousands of children through Snapology’s growing franchise network. This project highlights my ability to design STEM learning that is interactive, scalable, and engaging—helping organizations expand while maintaining high-quality educational experiences.
