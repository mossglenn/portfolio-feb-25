          Even the basics of genetics education are vast and complex, so
          delaying training until we had a fully analyzed curriculum wasn’t an
          option—staff were already fielding questions about DNA, genetic
          testing, and privacy. Instead of spending months mapping every
          learning objective in detail, we took an agile-inspired approach:
          defining broad learning domains, launching an MVP training in weeks,
          and refining it based on real-time learner feedback. This allowed us
          to scale genetics education efficiently while ensuring staff had the
          confidence to discuss genetic research, privacy, and ethics in an
          accurate and culturally responsive way.

📌 Scaling Genetics Education: An Agile Approach to Instructional Program Design

An Agile Approach to Science Communication

Even the basics of genetics education are vast and complex, so delaying training until we had a fully analyzed curriculum wasn’t an option—staff were already fielding questions about DNA, genetic testing, and privacy. Instead of spending months mapping every learning objective in detail, we took an agile-inspired approach: defining broad learning domains, launching an MVP training in weeks, and refining it based on real-time learner feedback. This allowed us to scale genetics education efficiently while ensuring staff had the confidence to discuss genetic research, privacy, and ethics in an accurate and culturally responsive way.

Background & Design Challenge

The All of Us Research Program is advancing genomic research to improve precision medicine. However, as genetics became a core focus, a knowledge gap emerged:

🔹 How do you equip non-scientists with the knowledge and confidence to discuss genetic research in a way that is ethical, culturally sensitive, and scientifically accurate?

Several challenges made this an urgent need:

❌ Limited Genetics Knowledge – Many staff members lacked foundational genetics education, making it difficult for them to discuss why genetic research is important to improving healthcare, even when given “talking points.”

❌ Ethical & Compliance Considerations – Genetic research involves complex topics—like inheritance and mutation—that affect informed consent and privacy, requiring staff to speak accurately and completely.

❌ Cultural Considerations for Underrepresented Populations – Ensuring culturally tailored communication was essential to building trust and encouraging participation from members of communities underrepresented in medical research.

The Solution: A Multi-Tiered Genetics Learning Program

To address these challenges, I led the instructional design and development of a responsive training program that provided various learning activities to allow staff to personalize their training based on their educational backgrounds—whether starting with the basics or filling specific knowledge gaps. To ensure rapid and accurate delivery, we used an iterative, agile-inspired approach, developing content as learning needs were defined, rather than waiting for a fully scoped curriculum.

✏️ My Role

🎯 Led project strategy, stakeholder collaboration, and communication

🎯 Designed the instructional framework and multi-tiered curriculum

🎯 Developed iterative workflows that accelerated deployment and refinement

🎯 Partnered with SMEs and engagement teams to ensure scientific and cultural accuracy

🧠 Solution & Instructional Design Approach

To create an effective and engaging Genetics Learning Program, I structured the learning experience around progressive learning pathways and clear subject organization.

✅ Agile-like Workflow

Rather than following a traditional waterfall model (e.g., ADDIE) that could delay training delivery for many months, I used an agile-inspired approach. With stakeholders, we quickly defined a ‘learning domain’—a broad framework of general needs—allowing us to launch a minimum viable training product (MVP) in just weeks. By continuously iterating based on learner feedback, we refined and expanded the curriculum, ensuring rapid, need-driven content development.

✅ Leveraged Existing Public Resources

To further accelerate the delivery of instructional material, I designed Genetics 101 to leverage existing educational resources publicly available online. Institutions like the  Genetic Science Learning Center and PBS have many accessible and accurate learning activities on their websites. Genetics 101 organized the best of these activities into modules based on topics All of Us staff would need to address.

✅ Multi-Tiered Learning StructureThe program provided a progressive curriculum designed to meet different learning needs:

Genetics 101 – A foundational training for consortium staff with no prior genetics background.

Genetics 102: Testing, Research, and Privacy – Focused on privacy, ethics, and informed consent.

Genetics Education for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Communities – Developed in partnership with the Asian Health Coalition, addressing cultural concerns and trust-building in research participation.

Talking About Genetics – Building confidence in answering difficult questions about genetic data, insurance, return of results, and genetic counseling services.

🏗️ Implementation & Delivery

✔ Rapid needs assessment: Defined high-priority learning areas with stakeholders in hours, not months.

✔ Content acceleration: Integrated existing trusted public resources (e.g., PBS, Genetic Science Learning Center) to deliver immediate, vetted educational content.

✔ Iterative development: Continuously expanded content based on direct learner feedback.

🎓 Results & Impact

📊 Increased staff confidence in discussing genetics with participants, improving trust and engagement🔬 Enhanced ethical and compliant conversations around genetic privacy and research
