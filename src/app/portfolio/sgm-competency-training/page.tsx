📌 Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) Cultural Competency and Humility TrainingMoving Beyond Awareness

Role: Instructional DesignerPartners: All of Us Research Program, PRIDEnetAudience: All of Us Research Program staff, public library staffTags: Diversity & Inclusion, Cultural Competency, Scenario-Based Learning, Accessibility, Stakeholder Collaboration, Community-Based Training

Hook & Background: Building Confidence for Inclusive Engagement

Even well-intentioned professionals can hesitate when engaging with Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) communities—not out of unwillingness, but out of uncertainty. What if I say the wrong thing? What if I unintentionally offend? This hesitation can create barriers to meaningful, affirming interactions and, in turn, reinforce the exclusion that SGM individuals have long faced in research and healthcare.

The SGM Cultural Competency and Humility Training was developed to bridge this confidence gap, equipping All of Us Research Program staff with the knowledge and practical skills to engage inclusively, responsively, and with cultural humility. More than just an awareness course, this training empowered learners to navigate real-world interactions with sensitivity and authenticity.

The Challenge: Moving Beyond Awareness to Meaningful Action

As one of the communities historically underrepresented in biomedical research, SGM individuals face systemic barriers to participation. The All of Us Research Program recognized that fostering trust and engagement required more than just policy changes—it required intentional, affirming interactions at every touchpoint.

A learning needs assessment identified three key challenges:

❌ Limited Awareness of SGM Identities – Many staff members lacked foundational knowledge of SGM terminology, lived experiences, and the specific barriers these communities face in research and healthcare.

❌ Lack of Confidence in Engaging with SGM Communities – Engagement professionals often hesitated when interacting with SGM individuals, fearing they might say the wrong thing or fail to respond in a culturally affirming way.

❌ Systemic Barriers to SGM Research Participation – SGM individuals have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research, leading to disparities in healthcare outcomes. Overcoming this history required more than just recruitment efforts—it required building trust through respectful, informed, and affirming engagement.

The Solution: A Multi-Layered, Interactive Learning Experience

To address these challenges, I led the design and development of an interactive training program that went beyond static cultural competency checklists. The training provided learners with:
✅ Practical, scenario-based strategies to navigate real-world interactions confidently
✅ A focus on cultural humility, emphasizing ongoing learning and self-awareness
✅ Authentic narratives from SGM individuals, ensuring the training reflected lived experiences

By integrating interactive learning, stakeholder collaboration, and real-world application, this training shifted the focus from theoretical awareness to practical, inclusive engagement—giving learners the confidence to foster meaningful and affirming interactions with SGM individuals.
✏️ My Role

🎯 Designed and structured an engaging, interactive learning experience🎯 Collaborated with PRIDEnet to ensure alignment with SGM community needs and values  🎯 Developed scenario-based learning exercises to strengthen real-world application** **

🧠 Solution & Instructional Design Approach

To create an engaging and effective training experience, I structured the program around scenario-based learning, community collaboration, and cultural humility principles.

✅ Interactive Learning ModulesI developed short, digestible modules that addressed:

Fundamental concepts: The distinctions between sex, gender, and sexual orientation.

Healthcare and research barriers: Systemic factors affecting SGM participation in research.

Best practices: Strategies for creating inclusive and affirming engagement spaces.

✅ Scenario-Based LearningTo reinforce real-world application:

Developed scenario-based learning exercises where learners practiced responding to common challenges in engaging with SGM individuals.

Included real participant narratives to humanize training content and highlight lived experiences.



✅ Stakeholder Collaboration for Relevance & Authenticity

Partnered with PRIDEnet to ensure training aligned with SGM community needs and values.

Used multimedia featuring members of PRIDEnet to make the learning experience as authentic as possible
