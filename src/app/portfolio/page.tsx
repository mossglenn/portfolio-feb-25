          Great learning experiences do more than deliver informationâ€”they{' '}
          <strong>bridge gaps</strong> between research and practice, between
          experts and learners, and between complex ideas and real-world
          application. <strong>As a digital learning designer,</strong>I create
          learning experiences that do more than informâ€”they engage, challenge,
          and support people in applying what they learn, while also driving
          meaningful outcomes for organizations.
