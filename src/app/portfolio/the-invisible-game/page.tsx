          Most games rely on visualsâ€”but what happens when sight isnâ€™t an
          option? The Invisible Game is a small experimental game designed to
          challenge assumptions about accessibility in digital design. The
          entire game is invisible and has no visual components, meaning that
          players who use screen readers can navigate and win effortlessly,
          while those who rely on sight and a mouse will struggle. Instead of
          designing accommodations for players with disabilities, this game
          flips the scriptâ€”sighted players are the ones who need accessibility
          support.

The Invisible Game: A Playable Accessibility Experiment

Most games rely on visualsâ€”but what happens when sight isnâ€™t an option? The Invisible Game is a small experimental game designed to challenge assumptions about accessibility in digital design. The entire game is invisible and has no visual components, meaning that players who use screen readers can navigate and win effortlessly, while those who rely on sight and a mouse will struggle. Instead of designing accommodations for players with disabilities, this game flips the scriptâ€”sighted players are the ones who need accessibility support.

Background & Design Challenge

ðŸ”¹ How can we challenge designers to rethink accessibility by making the need for accommodations visible?

Accessibility in digital design is often treated as an afterthought, with features added to assist users with disabilities. However, what if a game was designed with accessibility as the default experience? This small project serves as a thought experiment in universal design, accessibility, and inclusive interaction.

The Design

To test this idea, I designed The Invisible Game, a game where:

âœ… Screen reader users experience seamless gameplay.
âœ… Sighted players encounter difficulty and require accommodations to succeed.
âœ… The absence of visuals makes accessibility the core mechanic, not an add-on feature.

Why It Matters

By flipping the typical approach to accessibility, The Invisible Game encourages designers to think critically about inclusive designâ€”not as an extra feature, but as the foundation of digital experiences.
