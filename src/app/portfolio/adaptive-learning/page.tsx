          Traditional learning experiences often take a one-size-fits-all
          approach, leaving learners frustrated when struggling or unchallenged
          when advancing quickly. Adaptive learning meets learners where they
          are, adjusting instruction based on their needs in real time. Across
          multiple projects, I have designed intelligent tutoring systems,
          adaptive problem-solving experiences, and data-driven learning tools
          that personalize learning and improve engagement.

Making Learning Smarter: Adaptive, Data-Driven Instruction

Traditional learning experiences often take a one-size-fits-all approach, leaving learners frustrated when struggling or unchallenged when advancing quickly. Adaptive learning meets learners where they are, adjusting instruction based on their needs in real time.
