Bridging Research, Instructional Design, and Stakeholder Needs

Complex research and innovation hold enormous potential, but theyâ€™re only impactful when researchers, educators, and stakeholders can understand, apply, and act on them. My work focuses on translating technical research into structured learning tools that help researchers navigate study design, write grant proposals, and bring innovations to market. By breaking down complexity and structuring content for clarity, I help researchers move from ideas to execution with confidence.
